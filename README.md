This Project was generated by [Ideal Django](https://github.com/mrShahsafi/ideal-django)

## How To Run?
```shell
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

```

## Overview

## Swagger UI :
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/schema/swagger-ui/#/`

Here’s a comprehensive documentation for setting up your project, including instructions for configuring Redis, Django Q, and running the project.

---

# **Project Setup Guide**

Follow this documentation to set up the project from scratch and get it running successfully.

---

## **1. Prerequisites**

Ensure the following are installed on your system:
- **Python 3.9 or higher**: [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Redis Server**: [Download Redis](https://redis.io/download)
- **PostgreSQL** (if not using SQLite, optional)
- **Pipenv or Virtualenv** (optional for managing virtual environments)

---

## **2. Clone the Repository**
Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

---

## **3. Set Up a Virtual Environment**
It’s recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
```bash
# Create a virtual environment (using venv)
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

## **4. Install Dependencies**
Install the Python dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you’re using **pipenv**, install dependencies with:
```bash
pipenv install
```

---

## **5. Redis Server Setup**
Redis is used for managing background tasks with Django Q.

### **Install Redis**
- On **Linux** (Ubuntu/Debian-based):
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install redis-server
  ```
- On **Mac** (using Homebrew):
  ```bash
  brew install redis
  brew services start redis
  ```
- On **Windows**: Use the [official Redis installation guide for Windows](https://github.com/MicrosoftArchive/redis/releases).

### **Start Redis**
Run the Redis server to ensure it is active:
```bash
redis-server
```

You can test if Redis is running by pinging the server:
```bash
redis-cli ping
# Should return: PONG
```

---

## **6. Django Q Setup**
Django Q is used for handling asynchronous tasks in the project.

### **Configure Django Q in `settings.py`**
Add the following configuration to your `settings.py`:
```python
Q_CLUSTER = {
    "name": "DjangORM",
    "workers": 4,
    "recycle": 500,
    "timeout": 60,
    "django_redis": "default",  # Set up your Redis connection
    "retry": 120,
    "queue_limit": 50,
    "bulk": 10,
    "orm": "default",
}
```

---

### **Run Django Q Worker**
Start the worker using the Django management command:
```bash
python manage.py qcluster
```

Ensure the worker is running properly before sending tasks to the queue.

---

## **7. Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file at the root of the project to manage environment variables (e.g., database credentials, secret keys). Example:
```
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0
```

Use **`python-decouple`** to load these variables in `settings.py`:
```python
from decouple import config

DEBUG = config('DEBUG', default=False, cast=bool)
SECRET_KEY = config('SECRET_KEY')
DATABASES = {
    'default': config('DATABASE_URL', cast=db_url),
}
```

---

## **8. Apply Migrations**
Prepare the database by running migrations:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

---

## **9. Create a Superuser**
To access the admin panel, create a superuser account:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to set up an admin username, email, and password.

---

## **10. Run the Project**
Run the development server to start the project:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Access the application in your browser at: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

---

## **11. Testing the Setup**
- Navigate to the admin panel: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin`.
- Test Redis by checking if tasks are being processed via the Django Q worker.
- Verify the application routes and functionality.

---

## **12. Common Issues and Troubleshooting**
- **Redis Server Not Running**:
  Ensure Redis is running by using `redis-cli ping` (should return `PONG`).
- **Django Q Worker Issues**:
  Make sure the `qcluster` command is running in a separate terminal.
- **Database Errors**:
  Verify your database configuration in `settings.py` or `.env`.
